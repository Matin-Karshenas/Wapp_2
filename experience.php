        <h2>Early Business Ventures</h2>
    </div>
    <p>
        Donald Trump's early career in business was defined by a relentless drive for success and an ability to spot opportunities where others might see challenges. His real estate ventures were some of his first steps into a world that would become his domain for decades to come. From New York City’s towering skyscrapers to luxurious resorts in far-flung corners of the globe, Trump’s business empire began to take shape. He not only inherited his father’s real estate company but also had the vision to expand it into a global brand, making his name synonymous with high-end, luxury living. His knack for turning underperforming properties into highly profitable ventures was the foundation of his early success.

        <h2>The Role of Media in Shaping His Brand</h2>
    </div>
    <p>
        A significant turning point in Trump’s experience came with his venture into television. In 2004, Trump became the host of *The Apprentice*, a reality show that brought his business persona into millions of living rooms. The show quickly became a cultural phenomenon, and the phrase "You're fired!" became one of the most iconic catchphrases of the 21st century. The television platform offered Trump an unparalleled opportunity to expand his personal brand, turning him from a businessman into a household name. His media appearances and television presence only added to his mystique, reinforcing the idea of Trump as a larger-than-life figure who couldn’t be ignored.

        <h2>Entering Politics: The Unlikely Candidate</h2>
    </div>
    <p>
        In 2015, Trump made his unexpected entry into politics, announcing his candidacy for the presidency of the United States. His decision was initially met with skepticism, as many saw his lack of political experience as a major obstacle. But Trump’s unique brand of politics, which focused on issues such as immigration, trade, and American exceptionalism, resonated with a large swath of the American public. His blunt, often controversial rhetoric connected with people who felt neglected by the political establishment. Unlike traditional politicians, Trump didn’t speak in the polished, careful language of a career politician. Instead, he spoke in a language that his supporters found authentic and direct, and his candidacy took off.

        <h2>First Term as President: A Divisive Presidency</h2>

        Trump’s first term in office, from 2017 to 2021, was marked by a whirlwind of major political, social, and economic events. His presidency was arguably one of the most polarizing in American history, with supporters and critics viewing him through sharply contrasting lenses. His administration enacted significant tax cuts, deregulated industries, and promoted a strong stance on immigration. At the same time, Trump's policies on healthcare, foreign relations, and the environment were fiercely contested, with many accusing him of pushing the country further apart. His handling of the COVID-19 pandemic became one of the most debated aspects of his presidency, with critics accusing him of downplaying the severity of the crisis, while his supporters praised his efforts to quickly develop a vaccine.

His "America First" ideology led to renegotiated trade deals, such as the USMCA (United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement), and strained relationships with traditional allies in Europe. Trump's stance on China, particularly his trade war with the country, was one of the defining features of his presidency. His administration also brokered historic agreements in the Middle East, including the normalization of relations between Israel and several Arab nations, a move that many believed would change the landscape of Middle Eastern politics for years to come.
